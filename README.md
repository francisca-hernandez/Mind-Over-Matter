# Mind Over Matter

## Project Description

What is this application? 
* Mental health and wellness tracking application. Includes mental health resources, a daily tracker and prompts you can use to log entries associated with moods for that moment. 

Why did we create this application?
* We created this application for consumers/users who want to be on top of and track their own mental health. We wanted to have a place where you can keep a journal of your thoughts and emotions and keep track of your own personal wellbeing and stay organized. In this bootcamp we all know how important it is to stay organized and on top of things while also maintaining self care and personal time.
